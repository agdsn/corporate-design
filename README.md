AG DSN Corporate Design
=======================
This repository contains the corporate design, like our logos and templates.

LaTeX Usage
===========
In order to conveniently use files with LaTeX, they should be installed into a
local TEXMF tree in the `tex/latex/agdsn` folder.

For TeXLive running the included `install.sh` script should be sufficient.
This script will install all files into your user's TEXMFHOME, usually
`~/texmf`.

For MikTeX please follow the instructions from the
[official MiKTeX docs](http://docs.miktex.org/manual/localadditions.html)
